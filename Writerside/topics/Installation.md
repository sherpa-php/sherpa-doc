# Installation

> You cannot add **Sherpa** framework to an existing project.
{style="warning"}

To create a new project using **Sherpa** framework, let's start 
by following the following installation steps:

1. Install **Composer** on your development device
2. Open your terminal app in your **projects root** folder, please **don't create a project folder**, 
it will be created **automatically** during installation process.
3. Run following command: `composer create-project sherpa/template <project-name>`.
4. At the end, you will obtain a new folder with an empty **Sherpa** installation:
**You are ready to begin!**

[ðŸ’« Create your first page](Your-first-page.md)
: Let's create your first page with **Sherpa**!

## If an error occurred

It is possible that the installation of **Sherpa** results 
in a crash accompanied by an error describing the problem encountered.
**Please read it.**

### Denied due to permissions

The installation is aborted in this case.
Please ensure that your **projects folder** allows system
to create elements in it. This is a misconfiguration of **your folder**, 
not a Composer or **Sherpa** issue.
