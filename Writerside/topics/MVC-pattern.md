# MVC pattern

## Introduction

**MVC** stands for **Model-View-Controller**. It is a software design pattern 
commonly used for developing user interfaces that divides the related program 
logic into three interconnected elements. This separation helps manage complex 
applications by segregating the internal representations of information from 
the ways that information is presented and accepted by the user.

## Components

### 1. Model
-  **Definition**: The model represents the data and the business logic of the application.
-  **Responsibilities**:
    - Manages data and applies rules to govern how the data is manipulated and retrieved.
    - Notifies observers (usually the view or controller) about changes to its state.

### 2. View
-  **Definition**: The view is the visual representation of the model.
-  **Responsibilities**:
    - Displays the data to the user.
    - Sends user actions (e.g., button clicks, form submissions) to the controller.
    - Updates the display in response to changes in the model.

### 3. Controller
-  **Definition**: The controller acts as an intermediary between the model and the view.
-  **Responsibilities**:
    - Processes user inputs received from the view.
    - Updates the model based on user actions. 
    - Directs the view to update accordingly.

## Flow of Control

The MVC pattern follows a specific flow of control:

1. **User Interaction**: The user interacts with the UI (view), triggering an event.
2. **Controller**: The controller handles the event. It interprets the user 
input and makes calls to the model to update its state.
3. **Model**: The model's state changes in response to the controller's calls.
4. **View Update**: The model notifies the view of its changes, and the view 
renders the updated data to the user.

## Benefits

-  **Separation of Concerns**: Each component has a specific responsibility, 
making the application easier to manage and scale.
-  **Reusability**: Components can be reused in other parts of the application 
or in different projects.
-  **Maintainability**: Changes in one component generally have minimal impact 
on others, improving maintainability.

## Conclusion

The MVC pattern is a robust architectural pattern that enhances the modularity, 
scalability, and maintainability of applications by enforcing a clear separation 
of concerns among its three core components: Model, View, and Controller.
